        <p>
			Hi and welcome to my data story! Throughout the course of ENGL 3844 at Virginia Tech, I have been learning about my data consumption and then looking into how that plays into the data consumption of our society. I am a lover of podcasts. Thus, I decided to explore how, when, and what podcasts I am listening to during one week. Enjoy!

        <p>
			Here is a visualization of my podcast consumption. Please click on the image to view a larger version. In this SVG, I am demonstrating what types of podcasts I listened to during different times during the day. As you can see, I consume a lot of news in the mornings. Additionally, I highlight how I feel after I listen to a podcast. Thus, what I am listening to can impact how I am feeling throughout the day.

        <h2>Social Data</h2>
        <p>
        	Not only does media play a large role in my life, but it also is an extremely large part of society. I first analyzed how I consume podcasts, then I investigated how podcasts are finding information on me. Please watch this video to view my findings.
